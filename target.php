      <p>Since starting at Target, I have been focused on creating augmented reality experiences that help guests "be at Target" even when they physically can't be at a Target store.</p>

      <p>For me, this work hits the sweet spot of what motivates me about working on native mobile apps: using the unique capabilties of smartphones to bridge the gap between physical and digital in a compelling and personal way. Augmented reality is still a technology that is new to most people. The clash between what the technology enables and what mental models people bring to it has been fascinating to observe. But as AR becomes more familiar, and as new devices (i.e. glasses) emerge to better take advantage of its potential, AR should continue to serve an important function for people shopping online, especially when it comes to questions of fit, size, and style.</p>
