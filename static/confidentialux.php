<h2>Hy-Vee and The Nerdery</h2>

<p> The Midwest grocery store chain <a href="https://www.hy-vee.com/">Hy-Vee</a> has two native mobile apps. Hy-Vee's Flagship app (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hy-vee/id1133785983?mt=8">App Store</a>|<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hyvee.android">Google Play Store</a>) has deals, coupons, lists, a tool for monitoring a fuel rewards program, and a section for renewing and transferring prescriptions, among other features. The app has over a quarter million monthly active users. Hy-Vee's Market Grille app (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/market-grille/id1146933785?mt=8">App Store</a>|<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hyvee.marketgrille">Google Play Store</a>) and <a href="https://marketgrille.hy-vee.com">website</a> are for browsing the menu and placing pickup orders at the Market Grille “grocerant” attached to most of their grocery stores.</p>

<p>The Nerdery completely rebuilt the Flagship app and created the Market Grille app and website. By the time I was brought on to the project both apps had launched and were in the App Store and Google Play Store. I was the Lead UX Designer for both apps (and the Market Grille website) from May 2017 through March 2018. I worked with a business analyst, visual designers, developers, QA engineers, and a project manager on a scrum team. Hy-Vee provided a product owner, though for most of my time on the project the product owner was not directly engaged on the project. The Nerdery also had a Creative Director who oversaw design work for mulitple Hy-Vee workstreams (The Nerdery also did work on the Hy-Vee website and Aisles Online, Hy-Vee's online grocery ordering website).</p>

<h2>Hy-Vee Market Grille App and Website</h2>

<p>From November 2017 through March 2018 we worked on the following enhancements to the Market Grille app and website, most of which are not yet public.</p>

<ul>
	<li>added the ability to <b>order for delivery</b> in addition to placing pickup orders (<i>status:</i> developed, but only available to whitelisted users) (<a target="_blank" href="https://sferrari.net//wireframes/MG_Delivery/index.html">Invision Link</a>)</li>
	<li>added <b>basket continuity</b> to the app/website so that users can switch pickup locations or delivery address and still retain the menu items they have in their cart (<i>status:</i> live in the app) (<a target="_blank" href="https://sferrari.net/wireframes/MG_Saved%20Addresses_and_Basket_Continuity/index.html">Invision Link</a>)</li>
	<li>added <b>post-order rating and tipping</b> so that users can rate their order and leave a tip commensurate with the service they received (<i>status:</i> developed, but behind a feature flag) (<a target="_blank" href="https://sferrari.net/wireframes/MG_Post_Transaction_Tipping_and_Order%20Feedback/index.html">Invision Link</a>)</li>
	<li>designed an <b>Order Tracker</b> for delivery and pickup, essentially the equivalent of Uber Eats (<i>status:</i> visual design complete and requirements written up, but not developed) (<a target="_blank" href="https://sferrari.net/wireframes/MG_Order_Tracker_Visuals/index.html">Visual Designs</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="https://sferrari.net/wireframes/MG_Order_Tracker_Wireframes/index.html">Wireframes</a>)</li> 
	<li>wireframed a <b>Marketing Inbox</b> experience where customers could receive messages and offers that could then be applied to online orders or redeemed in the restaurant (<a target="_blank" href="https://sferrari.net//wireframes/MG_Marketing_Inbox_Wireframes/index.html">Invision Link</a>)</li>
	<li>added <b>Apple Pay and Google Pay</b> to the apps and to the website (Apple Pay for Safari on iOS and macOS, Google Pay on Chrome for Android) (<i>status:</i> designed but not developed) (<a target="_blank" href="https://sferrari.net/wireframes/MG_Apple%20Pay_and_Google%20Pay/index.html">Invision Link</a>)</li> 
	<li>added a <b>Saved Addresses</b> feature so that users could quickly enter their delivery address or find the nearest pickup location (<i>status:</i> live in the app) (<a target="_blank" href="https://sferrari.net/wireframes/MG_Saved%20Addresses_and_Basket_Continuity/index.html">Invision Link</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hy-Vee Flagship App</h2>

<p>App enhancements we designed, developed, and shipped between May-December 2017:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>In-Store Notifications</b>, a new feature triggered by Bluetooth beacons placed in the stores</li>
		<li><b>Redesigned Onboarding</b> for new users of the app (<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NbV0eJv1psmxFmD6PtQJY_eR4Z180TJ-sE4iOrqovqw/edit?usp=sharing">View Case Study</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="https://sferrari.net/wireframes/HV_FS_Onboarding_Enhancements/index.html">Invision Link</a>)</li>
		<li><b>Product Locator</b> feature with the ability to search by voice (<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NbV0eJv1psmxFmD6PtQJY_eR4Z180TJ-sE4iOrqovqw/edit#slide=id.p">View Case Study</a>) (<a target="_blank" href="https://sferrari.net/wireframes/HV_FS_Product_Locator/index.html">Invision Link</a>)</li>

	</ul>

<h2>Building an ERP for Whole Foods from the ground up</h2>

<p>Shortly after joining the Nerdery, I worked on a project in which we assisted a software company (Infor) in their effort to build a brand new Enterprise Resource Planning tool. Infor had entered into a co-development partnership with Whole Foods to build a system that was based in the cloud and flexible enough to meet their needs. Needless to say, this was a major undertaking and I learned a lot about all the internal systems that are used to run a national retailer. I was the second designer to join the project from the Nerdery, and I initially worked on the Item Management tool, before moving to do research and design for the Supplier Portal System within the ERP, and then finally working in support of the UX Lead Designer on the Pricing workstream. </p>

<p>Highlights from this project included:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>working on a long-term, agile project</li>
		<li>research and design for Item Management functionality (Item Detail in particular)</li>
		<li>conducting usability tests on Item Management with Whole Food’s global data administrators at their headquarters in Austin, Texas</li>
		<li>designing the Hierarchy system within the Item Management tool, and being the lead UX designer for that workstream</li>
		<li>briefly leading the team of ~10 designers while the UX Lead was on maternity leave</li>
		<li>conducting research for the Supplier Portal System (which included interviewing suppliers and retailers), creating the initial designs for the product catalog, and supervising the work of a client-side designer who worked on the supplier profiles</li>
		<li>working on the Pricing workstream</li>
	</ul>

<p>Some design artifacts of note:</p>

<h2>Walkthroughs</h2>

<p>If you really want to get a sense of my work process, the following sections provide walkthroughs on my process on certain features, plus things I learned along the way.</p>

<h3>In-Store Notifications</h3>

<p>When I first joined the team in late May of 2017, my first task was to design the onboarding experience for In-Store Notifications, a new feature that was enabled by the placement of Bluetooth beacons in each store. The goal of In-Store Notifications was to provide users with helpful reminders as they walked into the store, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>fuel rewards that are set to expire soon</li>
	<li>prescriptions ready to pick up</li>
	<li>items on their shopping list</li>
	<li>special deals</li>
</ul>

<p>With a feature that integrates with an external hardware device like a Bluetooth beacon, a lot can go wrong, making the onboarding experience a particularly important one. On iOS, the following things need to be enabled or turned on to make everything work:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Notification permission</li>
	<li>Always On location permission</li>
	<li>Bluetooth</li>
</ul>

<p>On Android, you also have to keep in mind that many users will turn off location services across their entire device as a battery-saving measure.</p>

<h4>How I worked through this task</h4>

<ol>
	<li>I collaborated extensively with developers to understand the technical constraints and the many ways things could go wrong.</li>
	<li>I reviewed how other apps would onboard users to a similar experience (including apps for the Apple Store, Nordstrom, and Whole Foods, among others).</li>
	<li>I sought feedback from multiple other designers, especially the designers who had worked previously on the project.</li>
</ol>

<h4>What I learned</h4>

<ol>
	<li>Onboarding is especially important for a feature like In-Store Notifications where a number of permissions and settings have to be turned on.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Redesigned Onboarding</h3>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NbV0eJv1psmxFmD6PtQJY_eR4Z180TJ-sE4iOrqovqw/edit?usp=sharing">View Case Study</a> | <a target="_blank" href="https://sferrari.net/wireframes/HV_FS_Onboarding_Enhancements/index.html">Invision Link</a></p>

<p>The app’s onboarding flow totaled 4 screens and was followed by an authentication/account creation flow that a user could bypass only with great effort. We knew it was too long and that the user should be able to see the value of the app right away, not only after logging in or creating an account. We also wanted to iterate on the coachmarks that had been included with the relaunch of the app.</p>

<h4>How I worked through this task</h4>

<ol>
	<li>I dug into the analytics to see how long it was taking users to go through onboarding plus the authentication/account creation flow. I also looked at login failure rates.</li>
	<li>I did a competitive review of the onboarding for other apps in the retail and grocery sector and how apps continued to educate users once they were in the app.</li>
	<li>I created a holistic approach for how we could improve the onboarding experience to get the user into the app faster and still educate them about the app’s feature </li>
	<li>After the new onboarding experience was released, time to complete onboarding went down by 62% (comparing stats year-over-year between March 2017 and March 2018).</li>
</ol>

<h4>What I learned</h4>

<ol>
	<li>Solid data can help win over a client who might be reluctant to change things in the app.</li>
	<li>General onboarding best practice: the best way for users to see the value of the app is to experience it first-hand. Getting them into the app as soon as possible helps achieve that and avoids drop-offs.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Product Locator</h3>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NbV0eJv1psmxFmD6PtQJY_eR4Z180TJ-sE4iOrqovqw/edit#slide=id.p">View Case Study</a> | <a target="_blank" href="https://sferrari.net/wireframes/HV_FS_Product_Locator/index.html">Invision Link</a></p>

<p>Prior to working with The Nerdery, the client had an existing app that was built using a cross-platform tool. Our first engagement with the client was to rebuild the app natively for iOS and Android. One feature that was dropped was the Product Locator, which helped users find items in the store. Many users complained about its absence and the client wanted to reintroduce it to the app.</p>

<p>My first step was to interview 3 users who had reached out to the client complaining about the missing Product Locator feature. I wanted to understand how they used the feature and what value it provided to them. One interesting insight was that one of the users would use the feature from home as a way to see if the store carried a product for new recipes that she would try out. I would never have thought that a user would use this feature in this way. And this indicated to me that there was more value to the feature than just locating the product in the store (and also that a deals-focused app will be used in unexpected ways).</p>

<h4>How I worked through this task</h4>

<ol>
	<li>After the interviews, I sought to understand what data was available through the API. An important piece of data in the search results was actually missing: the product name. This greatly impacted how the search results were designed, and I included the “section name” in addition to the aisle number in order to provide them with more context about the results (given that we could not tell the user the actual product name).</li>
	<li>I worked with developers to understand how we could interact with Siri and a Google voice search API to enable voice-based searches. Although speech-to-text dictation is available by default on the keyboard, the client desired to make searching by voice more accessible to users.</li>
	<li>I worked closely with the Creative Director to polish the visual design of the feature.</li>
</ol>

<h4>What I learned</h4>

<ol>
	<li>The interviews with Product Locator users served as a good reminder that you can never fully predict how a user will use a product or feature.</li>
	<li>Both Apple and Google help you embed voice search into your apps, but in quite different ways.</li>
</ol>

<h3>In-Store Research</h3>

<p>A year after the launch of the new app, we wanted to see how customers were using the app. While analytics can tell us <em>what</em> is happening in the app, to understand how and why this is happening you have to go further. The goal of this round of research was to understand what improvements could be made to the app, and to inform the app’s future roadmap.</p>

<p>We arranged with the client that we would visit 3 stores in a variety of settings (rural, and two suburban ones in different states). Working in a team of 3 designers (though we did seek to bring along a developer, we did not manage to do so), we would intercept shoppers as they walked into the store and try to find an app user willing to talk to us.</p>

<p>We reserved a booth in the restaurant in the grocery store and would talk to users there. After a brief conversation, we asked the users to show us on their device what was the most recent thing they did in the app, followed by any other frequent actions that they do in the app. We recorded their interactions on the app using a smartphone mounted on a small tripod (a Gorillapod). </p>

<p>Using our recordings and notes, we started building an Airtable of research “nuggets” (<a href="https://medium.com/@tsharon/the-atomic-unit-of-a-research-insight-7bf13ec8fabe#.34h11em65">an approach Tomer Sharon has written about</a>). As more research is conducted, we can add to this Airtable as needed, and organize and sort along any number of vectors (ask me about it!)(some example templates are avalable from Airtable <a href="https://blog.airtable.com/3-user-research-templates-built-by-ux-experts/">here</a>).</p>

<h4>What I learned</h4>

<ol>
	<li>Intercepting customers walking in to the store and finding one willing to talk (even for compensation) can be hard, but worth the effort because you can get a better feeling for the customer and their shopping experience.</li>
	<li>We had a lot of success in our first suburban store, not so much in the rural store, where smartphone usage was much lower.</li>
	<li>We have since decided to build an SDK into the app that will allow us to conduct remote testing with customers across the Midwest.</li>
</ol>



<h2>What I can contribute to the team</h2>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Research</strong>: I can elicit insight from user research and distill that insight into actionable hypotheses that can go into a backlog. I enjoy interviewing users, understanding their underlying needs, and also serving as a bridge between users and the product team (I keep the product team aware on an ongoing basis of what users are saying and how their work is having an impact on them).</li>
	<li><strong>Design</strong>: Whatever the situation calls for (whether it is whiteboarding, sketching on paper, diagramming in Omnigraffle, designing in Sketch, or prototyping in Axure), I am comfortable turning to the ideal solution to figure out the problem - which might just be a conversation with a developer. While I work well within an existing design system, visual design and animation are two areas where I usually turn to an expert. The article <a href="http://blog.capwatkins.com/the-boring-designer">“The Boring Designer”</a> by Cap Watkins encapsulates a lot of my thoughts on how designers should operate and work within a team.</li>
	<li><strong>A collaborative partner</strong>: I prefer working collaboratively with designers and developers from the beginning rather than retreating into a "designer cave" and coming back to validate. I frequently seek feedback on my design work, and ideally will test it with users as well.</li>
	<li><strong>Mobile expertise</strong>: I know Apple’s HIG and the Material Design guidelines well, and I stay up-to-date on the latest capabilities offered by the platforms (for example, the recent introductions of ARKit and CoreML from Apple, and ARCore and TensorFlow Lite from Google).</li>
	<li><strong>Retail industry knowledge</strong>: I have been working on retail-related projects since 2015, and in that time I have been keeping myself aware of industry trends, and more recently on the latest trends in retail apps.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Some things to know about me</h2>

<ol>
	<li>I am passionate about learning and I seek out likeminded people who are interested in sharing their knowledge. This is part of what I love about the UX field in general, that so many people are eager to learn more about human behavior and its intersection with technology.</li>
	<li>My career focus is on native mobile app design and research. While websites have a vital and important role to play, I am most excited about all the potential that mobile apps have due to their integration with on-device technologies and the intimate relationship users have with apps. As Luke Wroblewski so eloquently put it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiyOTcVHqHw">native mobile apps "connect physical and digital spaces."</a></li>
	<li>I enjoy working on teams that are built on trusting relationships between team members who are dedicated to honing their craft and building the best possible product.</li>
	<li>I find agile projects the most appealing because they combine two things that are very important for any designer or researcher: learning through feedback, and iteration.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you for your time and consideration!</p>
