          <p>As part of a group project in my Information Resources and Services class, we put together a Research Guide for undergraduate students at the University of Michigan studying the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S. in the 50s and 60s. Here's a screenshot of the main page:</p>

          <p>After looking at several Content Management Systems for the project, we settled on WordPress for our CMS. I was responsible for the hosting, installation, configuration, and administration of the CMS. With input from my fellow group members I also chose the design and layout of the site and I was generally responsible for its appearance. Our group worked together on the information architecture for the site and the arrangement of the navigation bar and the menu structure.</p>
          
          <p>Content-wise I the researched and wrote the Audiovisual section of the Research Guide, a screenshot of which is below.</p>
