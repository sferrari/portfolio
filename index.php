        <p>I'm a designer and researcher with over 7 years of experience in design, and a previous career as a teacher and academic. My goal is to make software that helps people in their everyday lives, and that creates sustainable value for a business or furthers the mission of an organization.</p>

	          <p class="box">I conduct research to understand people's mental models and the Job To Be Done of a product. I take care to understand the business constraints and help craft the strategic direction of the product.</p>

	          <p class="box">I value the creative stewardship of ideas, from initial sketches to functional prototypes, and the give-and-take between team members to achieve the best product possible.</p>

	          <p class="box">I create and test realistic prototypes to learn what works and what can be improved. I monitor feedback and performance to identify enhancements. Almost as valuable as the product itself, is the new understanding we gain from it.</p>

    <h2>Things to know about me</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>I have a passion for native mobile app design. As Luke Wroblewski eloquently put it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiyOTcVHqHw">native mobile apps "connect physical and digital spaces"</a> and that's a pretty exciting space to be in. I know Apple‚Äôs HIG and the Material Design guidelines well, and I stay up-to-date on the latest capabilities and design patterns offered by the platforms.</li>
        <li>The article <a href="https://capwatkins.com/blog/the-boring-designer">‚ÄúThe Boring Designer‚Äù</a> by Cap Watkins encapsulates a lot of my thoughts on how designers should operate and work within a team.</li>
        <li>This <a href="https://www.designbetter.co/podcast/marty-cagan">interview of Marty Cagan</a> describes pretty well the kind of product designer I aspire to be.</li>
        <li>In another life, I might have been a librarian. I like to organize information and create documentation that can help the team and other designers find what they need.</li>
        <li>Pithy opinions available on <a href="https://twitter.com/_sferrari">Twitter</a>.</li>
        <li>Photography available on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sebferrari/">Instagram</a>.</li>
        <li>Being half Danish, I'm uncomfortable with how many times I have said "I" on this page üò¨</li>
        <li>Being half Argentinean, I'd like to tell you even more - maybe over coffee some time!‚òïÔ∏èüòÄ</li>
