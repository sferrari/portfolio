      <h1>The Nerdery <small>Experience Designer (June 2015 - May 2018)</small></h1>
    </div>

      <p><a href="https://www.nerdery.com/">The Nerdery</a> is a custom software design and development firm in Bloomington, Minnesota, with offices in Chicago, Kansas City, and Phoenix. It started out as a dev shop for agencies, later added design, and has  expanded into strategy. "Nerds" include devs from a wide variety of tech stacks, business analysts, strategists, designers, researchers, content strategists, project managers/scrum masters, and quality assurance engineers. Clients range from community colleges to tech giants (Google) and other national and international firms (like Verizon and 3M).</p>
      
      <p>I counted myself lucky to work with brilliant engineers, designers, and researchers, and others, as well as with clients who were willing to leverage technology to improve their customers' experiences.</p>

      <p>Below I list out some of the projects I worked on, and where possible I link to the publicly available end product. If you want more details or examples of deliverables and design artifacts, please feel free to <a href="https://sferrari.net/contact.php">get in touch.</a></p>

            <p>Hy-Vee initially engaged The Nerdery to <a href="https://www.nerdery.com/case-studies/hy-vee">revamp their Flagship app.</a> As our partnership grew, Hy-Vee tasked The Nerdery with creating a best-in-class food-ordering app and website for their Market Grille restaurants, an early leader in the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/04/05/grocerants-take-bite-out-restaurants/99723098/">emerging</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/tags/541697402/groceraunts">‚Äúgrocerant‚Äù</a> <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/04/05/grocerants-take-bite-out-restaurants/99723098/">category</a> (where grocery stores have a restaurant attached to them).</p>

            <h3>What We Accomplished</h3>
            <p>Hy-Vee's Market Grille app (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/market-grille/id1146933785?mt=8">App Store</a>|<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hyvee.marketgrille">Google Play Store</a>) and <a href="https://marketgrille.hy-vee.com/">website</a> had already been built and launched by the time I began working on it. Most of the work I did on it is not yet publicly available so I can‚Äôt write about it here (<a href="https://sferrari.net/contact.php">get in touch</a>). But here are some features that are in the production app and website:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>added <b>basket continuity</b> so that users can switch pickup locations and still retain the menu items they have in their cart</li>
                <li>added a <b>Saved Addresses</b> feature so that users could quickly find the nearest pickup location </li>
                <li>and a good number of other things that are not public yet (hmm, I wonder what else "Saved Addresses" would be useful for... üòâ)</li>
              </ul>

        <div>
            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><b>The food ordering space is heating up:</b> the most prominent food and dining brands are all investing heavily in apps and websites that reduce friction in ordering, eliminate wait times, and augment the overall customer experience</li>
              <li>Analytics showed a key difference (oft-repeated) between websites and apps: <b>the website is about reach</b> (there were many more visitors and users of the website) whereas <b>the apps are about loyalty</b> (a smaller user base, with repeated engagement)</li>
              <li>The key advantage of mobile apps is that <b>the combination of notifications and location-awareness</b> can produce a food-ordering experience that keeps the user informed without added work on their part.</li>
              <li><b>Sprint retrospectives</b> are possibly the most important tool/milestone in the agile process to get your team producing at a high-level, sprint after sprint. If you aren't doing them, fight until you make it happen.</li>
              <li>We designed a <b>UX-BA sprint plan</b> that mirrors the dev sprint plan, and it turned out to be rather effective (if you are familiar with dual-track agile, it was pretty close to that).</li>

          <h3>Origin Story</h3>
          <p>Hy-Vee engaged the The Nerdery to rebuild its flagship app natively for iOS and Android. This rebuilt app launched in September 2016. Hy-Vee's app (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hy-vee/id1133785983?mt=8">App Store</a>|<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hyvee.android">Google Play Store</a>) has deals, coupons, lists, a tool for monitoring a fuel rewards program, and a section for renewing and transferring prescriptions, among other features. This app has more than a quarter million monthly active users.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>What We Accomplished</h3>
          <p>By the time I was brought on to the project both apps had launched and were in the App Store and Google Play Store. Features the team accomplished after I joined included:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>implemented <b>In-Store Notifications</b>, a new feature triggered by Bluetooth beacons placed in the stores</li>
              <li><b>redesigned onboarding</b> for new users of the app</li>
              <li>added a Product Locator</b> feature with the ability to search by voice</li>
              <li><b>In-store research</b> visits to conduct usability tests</li>
              <li>added <b>Siri integration</b> to manage lists and view Fuel Saver balance and QR code (new domains for Siri as of iOS 11)</li>
              <li>added new, personalized type of deals to the app</li>
            </ul>

      <div>
          <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The best way for a user to understand the value of an app is to be able to use it as soon as possible. We lowered the barriers to entry in our redesigned onboarding so that user could more quickly start using the app.</li>
            <li>When an app is geared around coupons and deals (and not shopping), customers will use tools like the Product Locator in ways that might be unexpected.</li>
            <li>Onboarding is especially important for a feature like In-Store Notifications where a number of permissions and settings have to be turned on.</li>
            <li>Intercepting customers in the store can be hard, but it's worth doing occasionaly in order to understand their experience of the store better.</li>
            <li>Educating the user about an "invisible" feature like Siri integration is important, but you need to educate them in a way that doesn't interfere with their usage of the app.</li>

          <h3>Origin Story</h3>
          <p>Most ERPs have the following flaws:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>they are on-premise</li>
            <li>they aren't easily customizable</li>
            <li>they are made for highly-centralized retailers</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Our co-development partner was a national retailer that allowed for a great amount of independence in each of its regions and even at the store level. They also had the need to quickly and easily add new attributes (like gluten-free, for example) as they brought in new types of products. We sought to build an ERP that would fit their needs, and most likely the needs of many 21st century companies.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>What We Accomplished</h3>
          <p>Working in separate workstreams, we researched, designed, and built out separate parts of the overall Item Management component of the ERP, followed by other components. I led UX first on the Hierarchy team, then on the Supplier Portal team, and finally I supported the UX lead on the Pricing team. It was satisfying to conduct research with users at different retailers and suppliers, produce designs that matched their workflows and mental models, and then test with those same users.</p>
          <p>Today the Item Management piece of the ERP is being used everyday by the co-development partner. The Nerdery remains engaged on the project, but the designers have ramped off after helping to build up the client-side design team.</p>
        </div>

      </div> <!-- gridwrapper2 -->
      <hr>
      <div>
          <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
          <p>This was my first project at such a large-scale: around 40 developers and 7 designers from The Nerdery were involved, with more on the client side as well. It was also my first project to follow an agile methodology (excuse me, I mean, an agile mindset üòâ), though really we did run through a few flavors of agile. I enjoyed working closely with the product owner and the developers. The sprint rhythm could be challenging from a design perspective, but so long as we stayed a sprint or so ahead and collaborated closely with the developers, it worked out fine.</p> 

          <p>Lastly, from a user research perspective, we really benefitted from having a co-development partner who was eager to make sure the ERP would work well for their employees. Access to these users proved crucial in testing a complex piece of software.</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.kalahariresorts.com">Kalahari Resorts</a> wanted to update its website to make its visual appeal more in line with its premium waterpark resort experience. They also wanted to make it a mobile-first site and better help customers plan out their visit.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>What We Accomplished</h3>
          <p>We interviewed people who visit waterpark resorts like Kalahari Resort and others in the Midwest and on the East coast. From those interviews we understood that customers appreciated having images and videos that let them see what it was like to visit Kalahari Resort. We also a discovered a <b>"job-to-be-done"</b> that was underserved by existing waterpark resort websites: helping the customer plan out their visit in a way that was easily shareable with family and friends who would be coming with them. Thus was born the <a href="https://www.kalahariresorts.com/pennsylvania/wishlist/">shareable wishlist feature.</a></p>

          <ul>
            <li>If you keep digging deeper in customer interviews, you will find ways of serving the customer that will differentiate the website from that of competitors.</li>
            <li>It is imperative to understand how mobile can affect site navigation, especially if you have a "hamburger" menu that hides away the main navigation. Each page needs to have strong in-context navigation that makes sure the user can find their next step even if they don't open the navigation.</li>
            <li>While initially frustrated that the booking engine was out of scope and decidedly not mobile-friendly, I came to appreciate how much we still had in our control to create an excellent experience for the customer.</li>
            <li>Thorough tree testing (we had around 3,000 responses to our survey!) can help the client make better decisions about site architecture and labeling.</li>

          <h3>Origin Story</h3>
          <p>Anoka-Ramsey Community College had not updated their site since 2008. In addition to having an outdated UI, they knew they were in need of better content governance to prevent a repeat of the 8,000 pages that had accumulated on their site.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>What We Accomplished</h3>
          <p>Working hand-in-hand with an external content strategist, we interviewed prospective students, current students, staff, and faculty, to understand what each audience needed to accomplish when visiting the website. A tree test helped solidify the new navigation pattern. And the content strategist helped content creators by coming up with voice and tone guidelines and a content governance plan.

          <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
          <ul>
	          <li><strong>Town Hall:</strong> An academic project involves a lot of consensus building and the need to bring along the wider community on the journey. We did that by seeking out stakeholder opinions and holding a Town Hall where we briefed the wider academic community on what we had learned through our research and what our initial designs and site structure looked like.</li>
	          <li><strong>Mobile navigation:</strong> It can be tricky to come up with a mobile navigation pattern that works well on academic sites given their breadth and depth of content. The pattern we ended up with actually borrows a navigation model that was used on iPods of old. We also supplemented the main navigation with an audience-specific navigation for easier access to commonly-used pages. As Peter Morville has said (I believe it was him): ‚ÄúAlways allow multiple ways in.‚Äù</li>
  	        <li><strong>Community college is one step in a journey:</strong> This was something we learned in our user research. We created a page that would help prospects and students see where a degree could lead them. We also came up with an idea of having student success stories that could be represented in the format of cards to help inspire students to see where their journey could lead.</li>
  	        <li><strong>Never lose touch with the dev team:</strong> This has become less of an issue by virtue of the fact that I am now more likely to be part of a scrum team and be able to sit together with devs. But at the completion of the design phase of this project, I became involved full-time in a different project at The Nerdery and I had trouble keeping connected with the dev team after that point. This resulted in a design decision being made without my knowledge that still haunts me (essentially the card flip interaction from the student success story cards was used in an inappropriate way elsewhere on the site that could cause the user quite a deal of frustration while navigating the site). For a long time I tried to convince the client to improve this, but in the end I was not able to do so.</li>
