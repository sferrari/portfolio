        <p>A few things to know about me. You can also learn more about me on <a href="https://twitter.com/_sferrari">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sebferrari/">Instagram</a>.</p>

      <h2>What I can contribute to the team</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Research</strong>: I enjoy interviewing people and understanding their underlying needs. I continually monitor feedback from people who use our product to keep the team aware on an ongoing basis of what people are saying and how their work is having an impact on them.</li>
        <li><strong>Design</strong>: Whatever the situation calls for (whether it is whiteboarding, sketching on paper, designing in Sketch, or prototyping in Invision), I am comfortable turning to the best method to figure out the problem - which might just be a conversation with a developer. I work well within an existing design system, but can contribute to the creation of new patterns as needed. The article <a href="https://capwatkins.com/blog/the-boring-designer">‚ÄúThe Boring Designer‚Äù</a> by Cap Watkins encapsulates a lot of my thoughts on how designers should operate and work within a team.</li>
        <li><strong>A collaborative partner</strong>: I prefer working collaboratively with designers and developers from the beginning rather than retreating into a "designer cave" and coming back to validate.</li> 
        <li><strong>Testing</strong>: I frequently seek feedback on my design work by testing with people who use the product. I utilize analytics to inform strategic decisions on the product and to decide on trade-offs as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile expertise</strong>: I know Apple‚Äôs HIG and the Material Design guidelines well, and I stay up-to-date on the latest capabilities offered by the platforms (for example, ARKit and CoreML from Apple, and ARCore and TensorFlow Lite from Google). For examples of this knowledge in action, see my writings on <a href="https://sferrari.net/blog/2017/12/05/floating-action-buttons-on-ios-yes-theyre-here/">floating action buttons on iOS</a> or Apple's new <a href="https://www.nerdery.com/blog/business-chat-for-ios-is-coming-heres-what-you-need-to-know">Business Chat</a> feature.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Some things to know about me</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>I enjoy learning and sharing what I learn.</li>
        <li>I have a passion for native mobile app design and research. As Luke Wroblewski eloquently put it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiyOTcVHqHw">native mobile apps "connect physical and digital spaces"</a> and that's a pretty exciting space to be in.</li>
        <li>I enjoy working on teams that are built on trusting relationships between team members who are dedicated to honing their craft, learning from every experience, and building the best possible product.</li>
        <li>In another life, I might have been a librarian. I like to organize information and create documentation that can help the team and other designers find what they need.</li>
        <li>Being half Danish, I'm uncomfortable with how many times I have said "I" and "me" on this page üò¨ - but the page is called "About Me" so I will make an exception üòÄ</li>
        <li>Being half Argentinean, I'd like to tell you even more - maybe over coffee some time!</li>
      </ul>
